# CCP+ (Streamlined) - WoW 1.12 AddOn for Nyctermoon Companions

Download the latest version here: [CCP+ (Streamlined) Releases](https://github.com/liminalwarmth/CCP-Streamlined/releases/)

This is a modified version of Ace's original Companions Control Panel addon for controlling the Nyctermoon private server Companions. It adds a third, ultracompact display mode to the CCP which uses shift, ctrl, and alt keys to efficiently control your companions while leaving as much screen space visible as possible.

It is _strongly_ recommended that you use this addon alongside my [Nyctermoon Context Menus addon](https://github.com/liminalwarmth/NyctermoonContextMenus) which makes the buttons hidden by the ultracompact mode easily available from a right click menu on companions.

## CCP+ Features

- Third "Ultramini" super-compact display mode added in addition to the default and mini modes.
- Use the shift, ctrl, and alt keys when in Ultramini mode to instantly issue click commands to specific companions by their role.
  - CTRL: Tank
  - ALT: Healer
  - SHIFT: DPS
  - SHIFT + CTRL: Melee DPS
  - SHIFT + ALT: Ranged DPS
- Visually displays which role is currently receiving commands with colored text to differentiate them.
- The CCP now saves and automatically opens to your last used window mode when you log in (open or closed and normal/mini/ultramini).
